# odin-recipes

This is the first html project that the Odin Project is using to help build upon the subjects
they have been teaching. The project will consist of a website that will have links to some
recipes. It is likely that creating this website will touch upon several of the topics that
have been reviewed so far, such as images, lists, links, and so on.
